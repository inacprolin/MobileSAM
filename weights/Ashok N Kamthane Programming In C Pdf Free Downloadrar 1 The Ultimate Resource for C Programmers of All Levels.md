Another strength of the book is that it covers some of the advanced topics of C programming that are not commonly found in other books. For example, the book covers graphics programming using C language, which is a rare topic in most C books. The book also covers dynamic memory allocation and linked lists, which are essential topics for data structures and algorithms. The book also covers some of the features of C99 standard, such as variable length arrays, designated initializers and compound literals, which are useful for modern C programming.
 
One of the limitations of the book is that it does not cover some of the topics that are relevant for today's C programming. For example, the book does not cover object-oriented programming using C language, which is a popular paradigm for software development. The book also does not cover concurrency and parallelism using C language, which are important topics for high-performance computing. The book also does not cover some of the libraries and frameworks that are widely used for C programming, such as GTK+, Qt, OpenGL, OpenCV and others.
 
Another limitation of the book is that it may not be suitable for all levels of readers. For beginners, the book may be too fast-paced and complex, as it covers a lot of topics in a short span of pages. For experienced programmers, the book may be too basic and repetitive, as it covers some of the topics that they may already know or have learned from other sources. Therefore, the book may not be ideal for everyone who wants to learn C programming.
