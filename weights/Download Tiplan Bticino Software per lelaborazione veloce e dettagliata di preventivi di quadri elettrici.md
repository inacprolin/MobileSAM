The software that you should choose for your project depends on your specific needs and preferences. However, some general criteria that you can consider are: the type and complexity of the system that you want to design or configure; the compatibility with your operating system and devices; the availability of updates and support; and the ease of use and functionality. You can compare the features and benefits of each software on the BTicino website or contact them for more advice.
 
Unfortunately, Tiplan Bticino is not compatible with Mac. It only works on Windows operating systems. If you have a Mac computer, you can either use a virtual machine or a dual boot to run Windows on it, or look for an alternative software that supports Mac. For example, you can try AutoCAD Electrical, which is a professional CAD software for electrical design that works on both Windows and Mac.
